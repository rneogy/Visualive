## Synchronized Visualization Interactions Across the Web
Visualive is a system that aims to explore the space of synchronized interactions on data visualizations across the internet. Core features of visualization interaction, including zooming, panning, brushing, highlighting, and rerendering a variety of data can all be mirrored on computers across long distances. We utilize web socket technology to power the synchronization of these features. In our exploration, we have designed an interface that represents other online users in a cohesive manner throughout all interactions by pairing users with colors. Zoom windows, brushes, and single-point highlights follow a user's color, indicating the source of interaction clearly.

The work for this project was split evenly among the team members. Development began primarily through mockups on whiteboards and rapid prototyping utilizing small web pages. Our technical stack comprises primarily of React and D3 for front-end, and Node and Socket.io for back-end. While a majority of our time was spent developing new features (chart types, interactions, etc), a significant amount of effort was put into refactoring and restructuring our system to allow for scalability and further development.
